# Smoluchowski-Diffusion-Equation
Here I created a Brownian Dynamic Simulation to help demonstrate the properties of the Smoluchowski Diffusion Equation. This project was part of a Final for a graduate Statistical Mechanics Class.

In this repository is both the jupiter notebook used to create an animation to simulate how a Brownian particle would evolve in a linear potential and the animation of how this particle would evolve. 

For more details, please see my edits added to the Wikipedia page of the Fokker Plank equation under the Smoluchowski Equation and Computational Considerations:
