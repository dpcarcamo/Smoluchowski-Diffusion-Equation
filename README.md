# Smoluchowski-Diffusion-Equation
Here I created a Brownian Dynamic Simulation to help demonstrate the properties of the Smoluchowski Diffusion Equation.

In this repository is both the jupiter notebook used to create an animation to simulate how a Brownian particle would evolve in a linear potential and the animation itself.
